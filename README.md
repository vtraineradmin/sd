## Additional Recommendations
- **Monitoring Exercise Intensity:** Utilize the Karvonen Formula for Target Heart Rate (THR):
  - Formula: THR = (MHR - RHR) x Intensity + RHR
  - MHR (Maximum Heart Rate) = 220 - Age = 196 bpm
  - Example for 70% intensity: THR = (196 - 108) x 0.7 + 108 = 159.4 bpm

- **Motivation and Consistency:** Given the barrier of motivation, consider joining fitness groups or classes to stay engaged.

- **Time Management:** Optimize workout times and integrate quick, effective routines like HIIT to maximize results within limited availability.

- **Pain Management:** Since the user has minor past head pain, ensure proper warm-up and avoid exercises that may strain the head or neck.

By following this structured and balanced workout plan, Mayo can effectively work towards his fitness goals, gain strength, increase endurance, build muscle, and improve overall health.
