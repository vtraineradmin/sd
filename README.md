  - Day 4: 153.87 kcal
  - Day 5: 291.5 kcal
  - **Total:** 1300.16 kcal

### Intensity Monitoring
- **Target Heart Rate (THR):** Using the Karvonen Formula:
  - **Max Heart Rate (MHR):** 220 - Age = 196 bpm
  - **THR Calculation (Assuming 60-90% intensity):**
    - Lower Bound: `THR = (196 - 108) * 0.60 + 108 = 149.6 bpm`
    - Upper Bound: `THR = (196 - 108) * 0.90 + 108 = 181.8 bpm`

### Recommendations
- **Stay Hydrated:** Ensure to drink plenty of water before, during, and after workouts.
- **Monitor Heart Rate:** Keep an eye on heart rate during exercises, especially with a high resting heart rate.
- **Consult a Healthcare Professional:** Given the high resting heart rate, it is advisable to seek medical advice to rule out any underlying conditions.
- **Gradual Progression:** Gradually increase exercise duration and intensity to avoid injury and ensure sustainable progress.
